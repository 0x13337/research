### Intro

If you are JavaScript developer and you are working with Node.js, chances that you've never heard about ```npm``` (https://npmjs.org) are literaly small :). ```npm``` is a repository, where hundreds of thousands ready-to-use modules for your state-of-the-art Node.js application are just waiting to be downloaded and used as a part of your codebase. ```node_modules``` directory in your project's root grows up exponentialy along with every new feature you are working on.

Maybe it's even more and **you** develop npm modules as well, providing your fantastic work to the community. That's really fantastic, I always encourage participation in open source projects and sharing your work with th eothers. Developers build this ecosystem and thanks to them this ecosystem is amazing.

There is many types of modules doing specifing things. One of those types are **static servers**, which allows to serve static content from your server directly to your users. They allows to eg. browse directories, edit files or work just like your small internal CDN for serving CSS or images to your app.
