### Research

#### Hidden directories and files as a source of sensitive information about web application

Some analysis about how to get information about web application from folders like _.git_ , _.idea_ and similar.
This whitepaper is still in development

#### CTF

**CTFtime.org**		  https://ctftime.org/team/12769

I've **started playing CTFs in 2015**, as team **bl4de**. My first year I've finished on **560th** place overall (I was in **9% of the best**, as there were **7272 teams with any points** - so I think it's not so bad for the rookie :D ) and 14th place (33 teams in total) in Poland.
Since 2016 I play also on my own as **Stack** - yeah, I am rather 'lonely rider' than 'team player'.

In **2016** I'm going to get position in first 500 overall and equal or below 12 in Poland :)

### About me

A few words about myself :)

I am Full Stack Web Application developer since October 2007 (professional career, but I was programming on my Commodore 16 when I was 15, in 1992 :) ). After 8-bit era (Commodore 16, 64 and 128) and 16-bit era (Amiga 1200) in 2000 finally I've get my first 32-bit PC machine with Pentium processor and 32 MB RAM. Then in 2002 I've finished my IT Associate Degree and started to learn evewrything else by myself. From time to time.
Unfortunately for me, I was able to start my professional IT career when I was 30, in 2007. Now, I've got more than 8 years of web development experience (both server and client) with several technologies, including LAMP and MEAN stacks as well as some experience with JavaEE enterprose applications.

During all of those years I felt that all IT Security related things is something I'd like to do most - so I've started to improve my knowledge in fileds like web applications security, network security and so on. 

In 2015 I've started to attend as many CTFs as possible, to do IT security related research, to develop tools for IT security world and to do all this stuff what some guys call 'hacking' ;) In the next years I'm going to take couple of IT Security online trainings and get some IT security crtifications (eWPT, eWPTX and eCPPT and OSCP from Offensive Security following OSCE). After that, with some professional experience, I'm going to become an independent IT Security consultant, penetration tester, white hat and bug bounty hunter.
