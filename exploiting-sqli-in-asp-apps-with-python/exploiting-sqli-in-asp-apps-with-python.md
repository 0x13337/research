# Exploiting SQL Injection flaws in ASP applications with Python

## Introduction

SQL Injection is one of the most dangerous and devastating vulnerability today. Even if this is one of the most discussed and described issue and also is the one to be quite easy to prevent - it's still quite common. In this post, I present how to identify and exploit SQLi in two different ASP applications with MSSQL databases.

Both examples come from realworld applications from two different bug bounty programs. Because I am not allowed to disclose any details about websites I've found them and both reports are not public (and probably never will due to programs policy) I will focus only on technical part.

Here's a short summary what I am writting about in this post, just FYI:

- how to exploit Time-based SQL Injection in ASP/MSSQL web application
- how to exploit Boolean-based SQL Injection in ASP/MSSQL application
- how to create Python scripts with Requests library to automate exploitation both Time-based and Boolean-based injections

## Finding SQL Injection in ASP/MSSQL web applications


## Exploiting Time-Based SQL Injection


## Exploiting Boolean-Based SQL Injection


##  Preparing universal Python exploit


## Putting all thing together - getting the data


## Wrap-up


Happy Hacking!
