### Intro


If you are JavaScript developer and you are working with Node.js, chances that you've never heard about [npm](https://npmjs.org) are literaly slim. **npm** (Node Package Manager) is a repository, where hundreds of thousands ready-to-use modules for your state-of-the-art Node.js application are just waiting to be downloaded and used as a part of your codebase. node_modules directory in your project grows up exponential along with every new feature you are working on.

Maybe it's even more and **you** develop npm modules as well, giving back your work to the community. That's really fantastic, I always encourage to take a part in open source projects and share your work with the others. Developers build this ecosystem and thanks to them it's amazing.

There are many types of modules doing specifing things. One of those things are **static servers** allow to serve static content from your server directly to your users. They can be used for eg. browsing directories, edit files or they can just work like small CDN for your CSS or images.
