This is my IT security related research repository - writeups, articles, PoCs, bug bounty descriptions and all that stuff.

If you'd like to know more about me - here's the link: https://github.com/bl4de/research/blob/master/README.md#about-me


### You can read now:

(There's no finished articles right now)


### Actually working on...

Leaks in web applications caused by hidden folders and files (like .git)

You can see _work in progress_ here: https://github.com/bl4de/research/blob/master/hidden_directories_leaks/hidden_directories_and_files_leaks.md

### CTF writeups

You can take a look at some of my **writeups from CTFs** events which I've took a part and resolved some tasks:

# Me online

You can follow me on **Twitter** if you want. I'm trying to share some IT security, web development and coding stuff. I am not following and sharing any politic or religious related content as I am totally independent and broadminded (I mean - I don't care :D )

My other IT security related profiles:

### CTF

**CTFtime.org**		  https://ctftime.org/team/12769

I've **started playing CTFs in 2015**, as team **bl4de**. My first year I've finished on **560th** place overall (I was in **9% of the best**, as there were **7272 teams with any points** - so I think it's not so bad for the rookie :D ) and 14th place (33 teams in total) in Poland (even if I don't live in Poland anymore, I will always play as Polish guy).
Since 2016 I play also on my own as **Stack** - yeah, I am rather 'lonely rider' than 'team player'.


You can see some of my **CTF writeups** from variuos events here: https://github.com/bl4de/ctf#ctf-capture-the-flag-writeups-repository

In **2016** I'm going to get position in first 500 overall and equal or below 12 in Poland :)


### Bug Bounty programs

**Bugcrowd**		    https://bugcrowd.com/bl4de

**HackerOne**		  https://hackerone.com/bl4de

So far nothing to see here - I will be describing all of my bounty I'll find.


### Other sites

**XSSposed**       https://www.xssposed.org/researchers/_bl4de/

Some of my XSS found in the wild.

**Project Euler**

Mathematic and algorithmic problems to solve. A lot of them :)

# About me

Hi,

Thanks for visiting my GitHub!

A few words about myself :)

I am Full Stack Web Application developer since October 2007 (professional career, but I was programming on my Commodore 16 when I was 15, in 1992 :) ). After 8-bit era (Commodore 16, 64 and 128) and 16-bit era (Amiga 1200) in 2000 finally I've get my first 32-bit PC machine with Pentium processor and 32 MB RAM. Then in 2002 I've finished my IT Associate Degree and started to learn evewrything else by myself. From time to time.
Unfortunately for me, I was able to start my professional IT career when I was 30 (well, you know, life is life...)


During all of those years I felt that all IT Security related things is something I'd like to do most - so I've started to improve my knowledge in fileds like web applications security, network security and so on. From now on (January 2016) I'm going to boost my security skills in many ways - I'm going to attend as many CTFs as possible, to do IT security related research, to develop tools for IT security world and to do all this stuff what some guys call 'hacking' ;)


In the next five years I'm going to get five IT security certifications (one each year): eWPT, eWPTX and eCPPT from eLearnSecurity and OSCP and OSCE from Offensive Security. Also I'm going to start professional IT security career in the next couple of years and finally with some experience - I'm going to become an independent IT Security consultant and penetration tester before 50 (I see the bright future for this business :) ).
Before this, I'm going to help some companies to improve their products security by taking a part in multiple Bug Bounty programs (HackerOne and Bugcrowd). 


Oh, and finally - one of my hardest goal is to be (one day, maybe) a speaker on DefCon or BlackHat event. Yeah, this will be definitely the biggest achievement of my entire IT professional life and I'm going to do this in the next 10, maybe 15 years.


Yeah, that's a lot of work to do. So let's do this :)
