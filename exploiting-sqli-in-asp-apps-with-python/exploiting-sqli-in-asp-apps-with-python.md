# Exploiting Time-Based and Boolean-Based SQL Injection flaws in ASP/MSSQL applications with Python

## Introduction

SQL Injection is one of the most dangerous and devastating vulnerability today. Even if this is one of the most discussed and described issue and also is the one to be quite easy to prevent - it's still quite common. In this post, I present how to identify and exploit SQLi in two different ASP applications with MSSQL databases.

Both examples come from realworld applications from two different bug bounty programs. Because I am not allowed to disclose any details about websites I've found them and both reports are not public (and probably never will due to programs policy) I will focus only on technical part.

Here's a short summary what I am writting about in this post, just FYI:

- how to exploit Time-based SQL Injection in ASP/MSSQL web application
- how to exploit Boolean-based SQL Injection in ASP/MSSQL application
- how to create Python scripts with Requests library to automate exploitation both Time-based and Boolean-based injections

## Finding SQL Injection in ASP/MSSQL web applications


## Exploiting Time-Based SQL Injection


## Exploiting Boolean-Based SQL Injection


## Preparing universal Python script for automated exploitation

Let's start to develop our universal Python exploit now. I'll be using Python 2.7 here, but if you are familiar with Python 3 (and in Python development in general) there should be no problem to port this to Python 3.

I use Requests library here (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/), which is a very good and popular module for HTTP requests handling.

```Python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import requests

def main()
    # here goes our code
    
```





## Putting all thing together - getting the data


## Wrap-up

Although this tutorial migth seems to be very theoretical and shows some 'overengineering' I've done (I could use sqlmap for example) - actually it reflects in 100% the whole process I've used in both reports and documents what I've learned or problems I've faced.

In Bug Bounty Hunting, as well as in Capture The Flag contests, Penetration Tests or any other security related activity - creativity is the key and many ways lead to the same result. Don't hesitate to try and learn new things. If you have never write even single line of code - try to learn Python which is one of the best tools to create custom tools, exploits and Proof-of-Concepts. Don't stuck with 'fire-and-forget' tools without understanding what actually is going on under the hood.

If you have any feedback, question (except HackerOne reports details about those vulns ;) ) - I am available on Twitter (https://twitter.com/_bl4de).
